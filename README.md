# Focalise

## About

Focalise is a productivity tool specifically made for adults with ADHD. Our website features a Google Chrome extension for ease of use when not on the main page. The main features of this app aim to solve the biggest challenges adults with ADHD face whilst trying to be productive online - focus, forgetfulness and sensory overload. The task management feature allows users to organise tasks into categories, organised by priority that will be suggested to the user on opening a new tab/entering the website. When a user wants to get to work they can set a work plan in the workspace, keeping the user on task whilst also sending reminders for regular breaks. If the user wants to take a break from their work/regulate after sensory overload, they can take a break in the sensory room. Here the user is able to set the time they wish to take the break and enjoy calm music/guided meditation/watch live animal cam. There's no need to stress about taking too long on your break as the website will keep track of your break left and redirect you to get back to work once the set time is up.

The Google Chrome extension shows your current tasks set with links back to the Focalise app, for easy access to Focalise's main features even while outside the website.

However you spend your time online, Focalise will make your online experience more productive and enjoyable.

## Development

The team followed an Agile methodology for the development of Focalise, using wireframing and Kanban boards. 

We streamlined our development process using our Kanban board on Trello. This allowed us to prioritise the demands of the projects whilst ensuring we weren't all working on the same files, helping us avoid Git merge conflicts as much as possible.

Using Figma we were able to plan out the design for our website before coding it, helping with a more consistent design look across all the team's work. Figma enabled us to conceptualise possible features in a way that allowed for joint planning and more discussions on any new design ideas.
